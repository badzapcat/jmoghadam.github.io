I've never blogged before, and I haven't read very many blogs either.

Of course, I stumble across various blogs from time to time when googling technical advice, or tutorials on various life problems, or whatever. But I've only ever followed two blogs.

The more interesting of the two was called _Grave and Most Glorious_, by an old friend of mine named Sam. This blog ostensibly chronicled Sam's interest in fashion, but large portions of it were about other aspects of her life. 

Sometimes Sam wrote about what was going on in her life right at the moment, and other times she wrote reflective pieces in which she thought back on significant events of the year. Of course, at any time, writing about some event could trigger a memory which would start her off on train of thought about another story further in the past.

None of this is unusual in the slightest. If you ask someone how they're doing, likely they'll tell you about the very same day. But as the conversation goes on, you'll naturally end up talking about other events at random points in the past.

I noticed this time-jumping phenonemon because it actually confused me when reading _Grave and Most Glorious_. You see, over the couple of years that I read this blog, Sam was somewhat frequently in and out of a relationship with a certain person. She wrote stories about this person and this relationship a lot, and the problem was, I always had trouble keeping track of whether it was currently on or off during the stories! She would start telling some memory about this person at an unspecified point in the past, and I could never tell if this was before they started the relationship, or after, or somewhere in between. At the time, I felt like this fact was important for interpreting some of the stories. Though honestly, upon reflection, it probably really wasn't.

Nevertheless, my conclusion is that blogging (and conversation in general), _naturally_ becomes nonlinear storytelling, whether you want it to or not. In other words, novel writers that eschew purely chronological storytelling are actually the ones who write more normally, closer to real life. Because we tend to learn about people's lives nonlinearly.

I am reminded of what my European history professor said to explain James Joyce: "The crime of bourgeois literature is that it pretends to make sense." The argument being that classic literature with its clean plot structure and neatly resolved character arcs is a naive, misleading caricature of real life. Since real life is messy and nonsensical.

I agree but relucantly. I'm not going to call for all literature to become absurd and nonlinear just because it matches life. The classic plot structure exists because it's entertaining and leaves you satisfied. Linear storytelling exists because it's easy to follow.

Last summer, I read two short story collections by contemporary authors: _Interpreter of Maladies_ by Jhumpa Lahiri and _Reasons for and Advantages of Breathing_ by Lydia Peelle. Both had very contemporary styles and often didn't really follow the pattern of `build up` --> `climax` --> `resolution`. Instead, many were highly anticlimatic. And I have to say, after reading most of the stories I felt a little disappointed and empty. I assume that's what the authors were going for. But my point is that it was less entertaining that way.

I don't mean to criticize these stories or authors. They were beautiful in their own ways. There's room in this world for all kinds of storytelling. So get ready to embrace the nonlinearity of this blog.
