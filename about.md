Hello!

My name's Joseph, though some people call me Joey.

I'm interested in language and education. My hobbies include reading, writing, arts-and-crafts, walking, hiking, running, and flipping coins. I love people, but I can be shy -- this conflict has been the source of much of the distress of my life.

I recently graduated from the Unviersity of California, Berkeley. Last summer, I taught a class there: CS 61BL, the second course for along the CS major track at Berkeley. You can check out our course website [here](http://cs61bl.github.io) (it's a wonderful class!).
