Dear diary,

Or not. I used to keep my thoughts in an entirely private diary, but after having been accused of being a too closed person, I've decided to open my thoughts to the world instead. I don't mean to presuppose that anyone will be interested in them; but here they are, for any curious ones.

In a way, the beginnings of this blog also celebrates my emergence into the real world. I have just graduated from college and am about to start a serious job. Although people legally become adults at the age of 18 in the United States, it is only now that I feel like I have become a full person. I am no longer merely a person in training (a "student").

What I've just written seems sufficient to start off the blog. I will close with one warning about this blog for the attentive reader: do not trust post dates, and expect retcons! I am a compulsive editor, and I expect to edit old posts frequently and without leaving any indication of doing so.

That's all for now! Peace out, reader.
