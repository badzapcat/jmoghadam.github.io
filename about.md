_Actually_, my name's Joseph, though some people call me Joey. Or Joe.

It's a bit hard to define myself at the moment. I just graduated from the University of California, Berkeley. Now I'm taking a gap year to work and apply to grad school for the following year.

## I'm fascinated by

a silly thing called language. I can pretty much talk endlessly about it; expect many blog posts dealing with language topics. 

I'm also interested in education. Last summer, I taught a class at UC Berkeley: __CS 61BL__, the second course along the CS major track. You can check out our course website [here](http://cs61bl.github.io) (It's a wonderful course!).

I love people, but I can be shy. The tension created by these two facts has been a source of much of the distress in my life!

## My life goals include

spreading empathy, understanding, and gentleness among the people of the world. The internet is a vicious and unreasonably negative place. I hope my little corner of the internet, here, can be a nice place.

## This website

is a repository for information about me, and my thoughts on life. I don't expect anyone to read it, but it's here so that in principle someone could. In the past, people have claimed I am mysterious, or that I don't say a lot about myself. That's because I haven't been convinced anyone is interested. But now people can read if they are really are curious. 

To be honest, this website is also a technical experiment. I know nothing about web development or design in the slightest, other than what I've googled online. So excuse anything amateurish that you see!
